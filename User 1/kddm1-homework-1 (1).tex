\textbf{Answer (d)} - Short summary of the main insights (with references to the corresponding image)
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Finding \#1, as illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:plot1}  illustrates the population by country, based on the dataset. China ranks highest with a population of 1.425 billion, followed closely by India at 1.408 billion. The next largest populations are as follows: the United States with 337.7 million, followed by Indonesia, Pakistan, Brazil, Nigeria, Bangladesh, the Russian Federation, and Mexico, which round out the top 10 countries by population.

This chart provides valuable insights into the distribution of population across the world, highlighting the concentration of large populations in a few key countries. It also illustrates a noticeable decrease in population size as we move down the list, with the gap between China and India compared to the other countries being particularly significant.
        \item Finding \#2, as illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:plot2}, the top 10 countries by reported fatalities are as follows: India leads with 153,972 fatalities, followed by China at 62,218 and the USA at 42,939. The fatalities then decrease in the following order: Brazil, Indonesia, Thailand, Iran, Russian Federation, Mexico, and South Africa.

India has the highest number of fatalities, which is consistent with its large population. While China also has a high population, the USA, despite a smaller population, has relatively high reported fatalities compared to other countries.
        \item Finding \#3, as illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:plot3}, the boxplot clearly shows that lower income countries tend to have higher and more variable fatality rates, whereas higher income countries generally have lower and more consistent fatality rates. This suggests that income levels might play a significant role in road safety, where wealthier countries may have better road safety measures and healthcare systems, leading to fewer fatalities and less variability in fatality rates.
        
        \item Finding \#4, as illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:plot4}, the boxplot reveals a significant difference in road safety between countries with and without a national motorcycle helmet law. Countries that have such laws show a lower median fatality rate and less variation in fatalities, suggesting that helmet laws are effective in reducing road traffic fatalities, especially in motorcycle accidents. In contrast, countries without helmet laws experience higher and more variable fatality rates, highlighting the importance of such legislation for improving road safety.
    \end{itemize}

\newpage\item\textit{Correlation}. Given a dataset, which consists of 1,000 variables (hint: most of them are just random), the goal is to find the relationships between variables, i.e., which and how do the variables relate to each other; what are the dependencies.
The dataset ``task2-dataset.csv'' can be downloaded from TeachCenter.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Which methods did you apply to find the relationships, and why?
	\item Which relationships did you find and how do you characterise the relationships (e.g., variable ``Lurkowl (Strix umbra \#1068)'' to ``Frosthawk (Accipiter glacies \#1064)'' is linear with correlation found via method X of 0.9)?
	\item Which causal relationships between the variables can you find (e.g., variable ``Rattlepuff (Lynx rattleus \#1067)'' causes ``Slingshark (Carcharodon slingus \#1068)'')?
\end{enumerate}
}

\textbf{Answer (a)} - Method and motivation:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Pearson Correlation Coefficient Method - Useful for identifying linear relationships between numerical features and easy to handle high number of variables.
        \item Scatter Plot Method - Help to visualize correlation and indecate the nature of relationships.
        \item Regression Analysis Method - Provides insights into the strength and direction of the relationship.
    \end{enumerate}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item "Danglefawn (Cervus dangleus #1067)" causes "Puffpounce  (Felis floccus #196)"\\ (Strong positive linear relationship - When "Danglefawn (Cervus dangleus #1067)" increases, "Puffpounce  (Felis floccus #196) also increases. )
        \item "Splashleopard (Panthera splashus #513)" causes "Shivershark \\ (Carcharodon tremorensis #824)"\\ (Strong negative linear relationship - When "Splashleopard (Panthera splashus #513)" increases, "Shivershark \\ (Carcharodon tremorensis #824) is decreases.)

\clearpage\item \textit{Outliers/Anomalies}. Given two types of anomalies: (1) anomalies are defined to be \textbf{datapoints} in low-density regions, (2) anomalies are \textbf{regions} of low density.
\begin{enumerate}
\item For both anomalies please create/draw a dataset of 2 features (x and y axis), with 3 anomalies and many normal data points (the normal datapoints should be marked, e.g., green colour)
\item Name the algorithms or describe the algorithmic way of how to identify this anomalous behaviour (you may also describe any necessary preprocessing)
\item Name the assumptions made by your algorithms
\end{enumerate}}




\textbf{Answer (a)} - Draw two datasets % Update the images to reflect a scatterplot of a dataset
    \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=.4\textwidth]{img1.png}
        \hspace{2cm}
    \includegraphics[width=.4\textwidth]{img2.png}
    \end{center}


\textbf{Answer (b)} - Describe the algorithms 
\begin{description}
	\item[Dataset 1] ``Anomalies as Individual Points Method'' was used and 9997 normal points were sampled from a 2D Gaussian cluster, and 3 anomalies were manually placed far from the cluster. This approach was chosen to simulate isolated, rare events, ideal for testing point-based anomaly detection methods like Isolation Forest and Local Outlier Factor.
	\item[Dataset 2] "Anomalies as Low-Density Regions Method" was used and 9997 normal points formed a dense circular ring, leaving a low-density center where 3 anomalies were added. This setup models structural gaps in data, suitable for evaluating density-based methods like DBSCAN and cluster-based anomaly detection.
\end{description}


\textbf{Answer (c)} - Describe the main assumptions \\
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ll}
\toprule
\textbf{Algorithm} & \textbf{Assumption} \\ \midrule
Anomalies as Individual Points Method & Normal data is clustered \\
Anomalies as Individual Points Method & Anomalies are far from the cluster \\ 
Anomalies as Individual Points Method & Gaussian distribution approximates the normal behavior \\
Anomalies as Low-Density Regions Method & Anomalies are from the low-density region \\
Anomalies as Low-Density Regions Method & No feature correlation \\
