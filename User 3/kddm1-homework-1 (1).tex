    \end{figure}

\textbf{Answer (d)} - Short summary of the main insights (with references to the corresponding image)
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Finding \#1, as illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:plot1} brings into focus the countries with the highest number of reported road traffic fatalities. India leads by a significant margin, with 153,972 deaths, followed by China with 62,218, and the United States with 42,939 fatalities. After these three, the numbers steadily decrease, with Brazil, Indonesia, Thailand, the Islamic Republic of Iran, the Russian Federation, Mexico, and South Africa rounding out the top 10.

These figures highlight the heavy toll that road traffic accidents continue to take in these countries. They serve as a powerful reminder of the urgent need for stronger road safety policies and interventions to protect lives on our roads.

        \item Finding \#2, as illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:plot2}, presents the year-by-fatality reduction targets for the top 10 countries with the most ambitious road safety goals. The Netherlands leads with the longest-term target set for 2050, reflecting a strong, long-term commitment to eliminating road fatalities. Following closely are Indonesia and the United States, both aiming for 2040. Other countries, including Iceland, Colombia, Algeria, Australia, Austria, Bahrain, and Bangladesh, have also established clear timelines for reducing road deaths. This comparison highlights varying levels of ambition and urgency among nations, emphasizing the global recognition of road safety as a public health priority and the importance of setting measurable, time-bound targets to drive progress.
        

        \item Finding \#3, as illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:plot3}, presents the fatality rate per 100,000 population in relation to the presence of key road safety laws, including national motorcycle helmet laws, national seat-belt laws, national child restraint laws, and national laws setting speed limits. The analysis reveals that countries where these laws are in place tend to have a lower range of fatality rates, as well as a lower median fatality rate, compared to countries without such legislation. These findings underscore the critical role that comprehensive road safety laws play in reducing traffic-related fatalities.
        
        \item Finding \#4, as illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:plot4},  illustrates the participation of countries in the GRSSR (Global Road Safety Status Report) commitments across the years 2009, 2013, 2015, and 2018. The data show that the level of participation remained relatively consistent over these years, with no substantial changes observed. This steady engagement suggests a positive commitment toward ongoing efforts to reduce road traffic fatalities.

\newpage\item\textit{Correlation}. Given a dataset, which consists of 1,000 variables (hint: most of them are just random), the goal is to find the relationships between variables, i.e., which and how do the variables relate to each other; what are the dependencies.
The dataset ``task2-dataset.csv'' can be downloaded from TeachCenter.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Which methods did you apply to find the relationships, and why?
	\item Which relationships did you find and how do you characterise the relationships (e.g., variable ``Lurkowl (Strix umbra \#1068)'' to ``Frosthawk (Accipiter glacies \#1064)'' is linear with correlation found via method X of 0.9)?
	\item Which causal relationships between the variables can you find (e.g., variable ``Rattlepuff (Lynx rattleus \#1067)'' causes ``Slingshark (Carcharodon slingus \#1068)'')?
\end{enumerate}
}

%%% Your answer here
\textbf{Answer (a)} - Method and motivation:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Pearson Correlation Coefficient Method - Used because it provides a quantifiable way to assess how strongly two variables are related and in what direction (positive or negative).
        \item Scatter Plot Method - Helps to visualize correlation and indicate the nature of relationships.
        \item Regression Analysis Method - Used to examine the relationship between a dependent (or response) variable and one or more independent (or predictor) variables.
    \end{enumerate}

\clearpage\item \textit{Outliers/Anomalies}. Given two types of anomalies: (1) anomalies are defined to be \textbf{datapoints} in low density regions, (2) anomalies are \textbf{regions} of low density.
\begin{enumerate}
\item For both anomalies please create/draw a dataset of 2 features (x and y axis), with 3 anomalies and many normal data points (the normal datapoints should be marked, e.g., green colour)
\item Name the algorithms or describe the algorithmic way of how to identify this anomalous behaviour (you may also describe any necessary preprocessing)
\item Name the assumptions made by your algorithms
\end{enumerate}}




\textbf{Answer (a)} - Draw two datasets % Update the images to reflect a scatterplot of a dataset
    \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=.4\textwidth]{img1.png}
        \hspace{2cm}
    \includegraphics[width=.4\textwidth]{img2.png}
    \end{center}


\textbf{Answer (b)} - Describe the algorithms 
\begin{description}
	\item[Dataset 1] ``Anomalies as Data Points in Low-Density Regions'' : A fixed random seed is set for reproducibility. Ninety-seven normal data points are generated from a multivariate normal distribution centered at [50, 50] with a small covariance. Anomalies are added at sparse locations: [10, 9.9], [99, 98.5],  and [8, 78]. The normal data and anomalies are combined into a single dataset, with labels assigned as 0 for normal points and 1 for anomalies.
	\item[Dataset 2] "Anomalies as Regions of Low Density (Hole in the Center)": A random seed is set, and ninety-seven normal data points are generated in a ring pattern around [50, 50] with random radii between 40 and 50. Anomalies are placed near the center of the ring at [48, 52], [36, 40], and [50, 52]. The normal and anomaly points are merged into a dataset, with labels assigned as 0 for normal points and 1 for anomalies.
